# connect4
My attempt at a Connect 4 game with a perfect computer player.

It has two modes: single-player and two-player. In single-player mode, there is (will be) a computer player that will play Player 2, as the user plays Player 1.
The computer player aims to play perfectly.
Eventually, a way to choose which player the user wishes to play as will be implemented.
